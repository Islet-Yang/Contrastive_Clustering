# Contrastive Clustering (CC)

Adapted from the structure mentioned in the paper "Contrastive Clustering" (AAAI 2021)  
Here we utilize it to classify micogolia dataset. Wide field microscope can record changes in microglia morphology and location, while analysis of changes in cell subtypes can yield new biological findings.  
This project is still in progress and will be updated gradually.
